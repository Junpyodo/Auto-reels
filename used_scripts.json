  "Subtly mirror their anxieties. They'll trust you implicitly, instantly.",
  "Evoke fear of missing out; Show what your audience *could* have, and watch them desperately crave it.",

  "Embrace the gilded cage. Luxury is a master; once acquired, your dreams become its demands.",
  "Control information, create scarcity, exploit desires: the rules they don't want you to know.",

  "Subtly plant desires. Suggest solutions; They'll perceive your product as their own ingenious idea.",
  "* Highlight their insecurities; then offer a solution only you provide, control ensues.",
  "**Unleash their ambition, then control the strings of their desires, shaping their reality to your liking.**"
